Write a class definition that contains a method that returns a random integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive).

Write a client main-class that invokes this method 1000 times and records each result.

After the 1000 invocations, the client should output the results, showing how many occurrences of each number there were:

1  was returned 43 times
2  was returned 57 times
3  was returned 50 times
.
.
.
20 was returned 44 times

Your results output can look any way you want it, just make it clear.

We haven't studied the java.util collections classes yet, but we have studied arrays (that's a hint).
